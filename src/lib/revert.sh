# Variable naming:
# under_score        - used for global variables which are accessible between functions.
# _extra_under_score - used for local function variables. Should be unset afterwards.
#          (Note the underscore in the beginning of _extra_under_score!)

# The following variables are declared globally.
# If you run this file independently following variables need to be set:
# ---variable:------------  ---default value:--  ---declared in:----------------
# hosts_file_path           /etc/hosts           src/lib/config.sh, adsorber.conf
# hosts_file_previous_path  /etc/hosts.previous  src/lib/config.sh, adsorber.conf
# prefix                    '  ' (two spaces)    src/lib/colours.sh
# prefix_fatal              '\033[0;91mE '       src/lib/colours.sh
# prefix_reset              \033[0m              src/lib/colours.sh
# prefix_title              \033[1;37m           src/lib/colours.sh

# The following functions are defined in different files.
# If you run this file independently following functions need to be emulated:
# --function:--  ---function defined in:---
